# Machine Learning Classification Dependencies
# These are optional - only needed to regenerate classification files
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-ml.txt

# Core ML libraries for embeddings
sentence-transformers==2.2.2    # For MPNET, MiniLM, and BioBERT models
transformers==4.36.2           # HuggingFace transformers backend
torch>=2.0.0                    # PyTorch for deep learning
scikit-learn==1.3.2            # For cosine similarity and normalization

# Progress bar for long-running processes
tqdm==4.66.1

# Data processing (also in main requirements)
pandas>=2.0.0,<3.0.0          # DataFrames for structured data
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0          # Numerical operations
requests>=2.31.0              # API calls if needed

# Note: Models will be downloaded automatically on first use:
